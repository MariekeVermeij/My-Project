Assignment: CD
Components:
I’ve  created a new Digital Ocean Droplet for this project. I created the app on a separate location form my working project. 
I’ve used a deploy key to have access to my repository and used github secrets to be able to store host ssh key and username.
I’ve used the ssh action of appleboy from the marketplace and added this to my test file. 
With the secrets I could have access to my server. 
Problems:
One of the problems that I encounter wat that I had already removed my digital Ocean account because I did not like it to become expensive.
But I found out that I had to use the information again for this assignment.
So I had had to do the redo the exercises for VPS running a Flask application. 
Another problem which took me a lot of time was the error “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'” 
Finally I added flask in requirements but with version. 
It worked out that without version the problem was solved
I fist would like to let the ssh-action read my sh file. But this dit not work out. 
So I’ve added the information just in the script in the yml file. 
It wasn't very convenient for me to have to run a paid server because I didn't have much time to work on it last month, so that felt like quite a waste of money. 
And I also think I got hacked so an unsafe project like this might be possible if you know it only takes a few days but it gave me quite a bit of stress assuming my server is being used by others and can't close it again because of the assignment.
